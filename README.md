## About Project

I'm trying to build a repo that I can store a number of Mathematical functions, maybe even algorithms in the future.

## Project Status

In Progress, Extremely in the beginning

## Install

## Use

```make run```

Or if it is already compiled: ```./bin/powMat```

### How to Run Tests

#### Create Tests

Create a file with the test name, no extensions, in the [input folder](tests/inputs). In this file write the pretended input.

Then create a file with the same name in the [output folder](tests/outputs). In this file write the pretended output.

#### Run Tests

```python3 Testing.py``` on **Ubuntu**

```python Testing.py``` or ```python3 Testing.py``` on **Windows**

```./Testing.py``` on **Mac OS**
